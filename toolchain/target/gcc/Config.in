		help
			uClibc++ is an implementation of the Standard C++ Library optimized
			for embedded systems (primarily for size). Its size is ~160KB.
			It however lacks a complete support for wchar type. It also has some
			performance deficiencies, e.g. std::map::find requires O(n), bubble
			sort O(n^2) is used as sort algorithm, and etc.

		bool "GNU libstdc++"
		help
			GNU libstdc++ is an implementation of the Standard C++ Library from
			the developers of the GNU Compiler Collection (GCC). It provides
			a full support for all features defined in the 2nd edition of the
			C++ Standard (ISO/IEC 14882:2003) and for many features of the
			upcoming version of the Standard. The only disadvantage it has
			compared to uClibc++ is its size - upto 900KB depending on the
			compiler version.
